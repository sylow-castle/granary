日本語版は[こちら](README_ja.md) (tranlate: this is in Japanese.)

Maybe I can write and speak Engrish. but I can not English.

This repository include a batch of my ideas. I am studying UNIX philosophy and be intersted anything in computing.  
so, I write various small code, for example, Powershell script, bash scripts, JavaScripts, Java, php, various configration files etc...
Since I have forgotten what I had written. it is mottainai ( 'mottainai' is term of Japanese origin).
So I log these small files in one repository. Maybe, I can not manage many repositories.

## Feeling

I try various things... but I think this repository which would contains Powershell scripts and bash scripts. Because it is executable in toushands of machines. I do not want to setting up runtime environment: Java, Nodejs, php, ruby etc... these work waste me. Maybe it is A command. ( So I like VM, Ansible... Provisioning tech.)
